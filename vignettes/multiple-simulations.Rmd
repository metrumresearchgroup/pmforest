### Multiple Simulations
In some instances, it may be useful to present the variability of each summary statistic (ex: median, 5th and 95th percentile). In order to accomplish this you must have a column denoting the run/simulation number. This column is then assigned to the `nsim` argument. An example can be seen below:

```
plot_forest(data = data_new , 
            statistic = "median",
            CI=0.95,
            stat = stat,
            covariate = GROUP,
            cov_level = LVL,
            nsim = nsim,
            shaded_interval = c(0.8,1.25),
            summary_label = plot_labels,
            text_size = 3.5,
            x_lab = "Fraction and 95% CI \nRelative to Reference",
            CI_label = "Median [95% CI]",
            plot_width = 9, # out of 12
            x_breaks = c(0.4,0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4,1.6),
            x_limit = c(0.4,1.45),
            annotate_CI=T,
            nrow = 1)
```

In cases where the additional confidence intervals overlap, you can vertically jitter them via the `jitter_nsim` argument (logical). An example can be seen below (note that the data is different than above):

```
plot_forest(data = plotData,
            statistic = "mean",
            CI=0.95,
            stat = stat,
            covariate = GROUP,
            cov_level = LVL,
            metagroup = param,
            nsim = nsim,
            shaded_interval = c(0.8,1.25),
            summary_label = plot_labels,
            text_size = 4,
            vline_intercept = 1,
            x_lab = "Fraction and 95% CI \nRelative to Reference",
            CI_label = "Median [95% CI]",
            plot_width = 8, # out of 12
            x_breaks = c(0.4,0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4,1.6),
            x_limit = c(0.4,1.45),
            annotate_CI=T,
            nrow = 1,
            jitter_nsim = TRUE)
```
