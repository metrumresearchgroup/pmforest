## Installation
`pmforest` is not currently on [MPN snapshots](https://mpn.metworx.com/docs/snapshots), but will be added soon.

You can install the latest development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("metrumresearchgroup/pmforest", ref = "main")
```

## Documentation

You can find documentation and a "Getting Started" vignette that shows users how to set up and summarize their data, as well as demonstrates the basic plotting methods. Additional formatting attributes are highlighted as well.


### Featured Vignettes

* [Getting Started with bbr](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/pmforest/articles/getting-started.html) -- Data specifications, summarization, and basic plotting methods.
* [Multiple Simulations](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/pmforest/articles/multiple-simulations.html) -- Plotting additional confidence intervals over the 'replicate' or simulation run.

## Development

`pmforest` uses [pkgr](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/pkgr) to manage 
development dependencies and [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to provide 
isolation. To replicate this environment, 

1. clone the repo

2. install pkgr

3. open package in an R session and run `renv::init()` 
   - install `renv` > 0.8.3-4 into default `.libPaths()` if not already installed

3. run `pkgr install` in terminal within package directory

4. restart session

Then, launch R with the repo as the working directory (open the project in 
RStudio). renv will activate and find the project library.
