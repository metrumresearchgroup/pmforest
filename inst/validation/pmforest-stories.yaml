PLOT-S001:
  name: Create basic forest plot
  description: As a user, I want to be able to generate forest plots using previously-simulated
    data for a model with various covariates set to fixed values, so that I can evaluate
    the potential for effects of covariates on model properties.

  - PMF-PLOT-018
DATA-S001:
  name: summary methods
  description: As a user, I want to be able to specify the type of summaries presented
    for each covariate level in the forest plot, including the location type (mean
    vs median) and width of the confidence interval (e.g., 90% vs 95%).

PLOT-S004:
  name: metagroup specification
  description: As a user, I want to be able to generate multiple forest plots from
    the same set of simulations, e.g., for multiple model parameters (CL and V) or
    multiple responses (AUC and Cmax) or a combination of both (CL, AUC, Cmax).

  name: Plot/table width
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to specify the relative widths of
    the plot and accompanying text.
  ProductRisk: low

  description: As a user, I would like the forest plots to show a vertical line at
    a specified value to show the reference value for comparison.

PLOT-S008:
  name: shaded interval
  description: As a user, I would like to have the option to include a shaded interval
    for the value being plotted, for the range that I specify.

  name: update labels via yaml file
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to provide custom labels for the
    covariates and response/parameter.
  ProductRisk: low
  tests: PMF-PLOT-011
PLOT-S010:
  name: plot multiple simulations
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to (when providing data from nested
    simulations) have the forest plots reflect the variability between replicates
    by showing additional confidence interval line segments above the overall values
    (i.e., above the mean/median and upper/lower percentiles).

PLOT-S011:
  name: label adjustments and positioning
  description: As a user, I would like to have control over axis labels, breaks, and
    limits, as well as text size for all text elements.

  - PMF-PLOT-023
PLOT-S012:
  name: Formatting options, ggplot themes
  description: As a user, I would like to have be able to change the shape and size
    of the median value. I would also like to modify the default ggplot theme.

DATA-S002:
  name: Column selection, summary
  description: As a user, I want to be able to specify which model property (i.e.,
    predicted response (e.g., AUC or Cmax) or parameter value (e.g., CL or V)) will
    be summarized in the forest plot.
  ProductRisk: high

DATA-S003:
  name: Summarize data by group
