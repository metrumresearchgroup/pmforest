PLOT-S001:
  name: Create basic forest plot
  description: As a user, I want to be able to generate forest plots using previously-simulated
    data for a model with various covariates set to fixed values, so that I can evaluate
    the potential for effects of covariates on model properties.
  ProductRisk: high
  requirements:
  - PMPLOT-R017
  - PMPLOT-R018
DATA-S001:
  name: summary methods
  description: As a user, I want to be able to specify the type of summaries presented
    for each covariate level in the forest plot, including the location type (mean
    vs median) and width of the confidence interval (e.g., 90% vs 95%).

  - PMDATA-R002
  - PMDATA-R003
PLOT-S004:
  name: metagroup specification
  description: As a user, I want to be able to generate multiple forest plots from

    the plot and accompanying text.
  ProductRisk: low
  requirements: PMPLOT-R008
PLOT-S007:

PLOT-S008:
  name: shaded interval
  description: As a user, I would like to have the option to include a shaded interval
    for the value being plotted, for the range that I specify.

PLOT-S009:
  name: update labels via yaml file
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to provide custom labels for the
    covariates and response/parameter.
  ProductRisk: low
  requirements: PMPLOT-R011
PLOT-S010:
  name: plot multiple simulations
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to (when providing data from nested
    simulations) have the forest plots reflect the variability between replicates
    by showing additional confidence interval line segments above the overall values
    (i.e., above the mean/median and upper/lower percentiles).
  ProductRisk: high
  requirements:
  - PMPLOT-R012
  - PMPLOT-R013
PLOT-S011:
  name: label adjustments and positioning
  description: As a user, I would like to have control over axis labels, breaks, and
    limits, as well as text size for all text elements.
  ProductRisk: medium
  requirements:
  - PMPLOT-R014
  - PMPLOT-R015
  - PMPLOT-R016
  - PMPLOT-R023
PLOT-S012:
  name: Formatting options, ggplot themes
  description: As a user, I would like to have be able to change the shape and size
    of the median value. I would also like to modify the default ggplot theme.
  ProductRisk: medium
  requirements:
  - PMPLOT-R020
  - PMPLOT-R021
  - PMPLOT-R022
DATA-S002:
  name: Column selection, summary
  description: As a user, I want to be able to specify which model property (i.e.,
    predicted response (e.g., AUC or Cmax) or parameter value (e.g., CL or V)) will
    be summarized in the forest plot.
  ProductRisk: high
  requirements:
  - PMDATA-R001
  - PMDATA-R003
DATA-S003:
  name: Summarize data by group
  description: As a user, I want to pass in raw data and summarize by group, and optionally
    level and metagroup.
  ProductRisk: high
  requirements:
  - PMDATA-R001
  - PMDATA-R002
  - PMPLOT-R019
DATA-S004:
  name: Summarize across replicates
  description: As a user, I want to calculate median, lower, and upper quantile, for
    each replicate and optionally across multiple replicates.
  ProductRisk: high
  requirements: PMDATA-R003
DATA-S005:
  name: Control significant digits
  description: As a user, I want to be able specify the number of significant digits
    for my summary statistics, and control whether to use scientific or numeric notation.
